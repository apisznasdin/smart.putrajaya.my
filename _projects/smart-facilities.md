- Manual override capability

## Energy Savings

### After-Hours Optimization
- Automatic dimming in unoccupied areas
- Complete shut-off when empty
- Security lighting maintenance
- Emergency lighting preservation

### Monitoring
- Real-time energy tracking
- Consumption analytics
- Cost calculations
- Savings reports

## Implementation

### Phase 1 - Kompleks PPj
- Office floors
- Common areas
- Meeting rooms
- Restroom facilities

### Future Expansion
- Other government buildings
- Public facilities
- Community centers
- Sports complexes
