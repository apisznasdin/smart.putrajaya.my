## Overview

The **Solar Rooftop Initiative** is Perbadanan Putrajaya's commitment to renewable energy adoption. In partnership with **GSparx** and **TNB**, this project installs solar photovoltaic (PV) systems on government buildings, starting with **Kompleks Perbadanan Putrajaya** and expanding to other premises.

## Project Scope

### Phase 1: Kompleks Perbadanan Putrajaya

The flagship installation at PPj headquarters:

| Specification | Details |
|---------------|---------|
| Location | Kompleks Perbadanan Putrajaya |
| System Size | To be determined based on roof assessment |
| Panel Type | High-efficiency monocrystalline |
| System Type | Grid-tied with NEM |
| Expected Output | Significant portion of building's electricity |

### Expansion Plan

Following successful Phase 1, expansion to:

- Other Perbadanan Putrajaya buildings
- Community facilities
- Public amenities
- Parking structures (solar carports)

## Technology

### Solar PV System Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Solar Panels | Tier-1 high-efficiency modules |
| Inverters | Grid-tied string/micro inverters |
| Mounting System | Roof-mounted racking system |
| Monitoring | Smart meters and sensors |
| Safety | DC isolators, surge protection |

### Net Energy Metering (NEM)

Under Malaysia's NEM scheme:

- **Export to Grid**: Excess energy sold to TNB
- **Credit System**: Energy credits offset electricity bills
- **True Net Metering**: 1:1 offset ratio
- **Monthly Settlement**: Automatic bill adjustment

## Partnership Model

### GSparx

As a leading solar solutions provider:

- System design and engineering
- Equipment procurement
- Installation and commissioning
- Maintenance services

- Grid connection approval
- NEM registration
- Meter installation
- Energy purchase agreement

### Perbadanan Putrajaya

As the building owner:

- Roof space provision
- Facility access
- Project coordination
- Sustainability commitment

## Benefits

### Financial Benefits

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Electricity Savings | Reduced grid electricity purchase |
| NEM Revenue | Income from excess energy export |
