## Overview

The **Smart Electric Meter** initiative, implemented by **Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB)**, replaces conventional electricity meters with Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) across Putrajaya. This modernization enables two-way communication between meters and utility systems, supporting smart grid capabilities and empowering consumers with real-time energy information.

## Technology Features

### Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI)

The smart meters incorporate cutting-edge technology:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Two-way Communication | Real-time data exchange with TNB systems |
| Remote Reading | Automated meter reading without site visits |
| Tamper Detection | Security alerts for unauthorized access |
| Power Quality Monitoring | Voltage and frequency tracking |
| Load Profiling | Detailed consumption patterns |

### myTNB App Integration

Consumers can access their data through the myTNB mobile application:

- **Real-time Usage**: View current electricity consumption
- **Bill Tracking**: Monitor daily, weekly, monthly usage
- **Cost Estimates**: Projected billing amounts
- **Comparison Tools**: Compare usage across periods
- **Notifications**: Alerts for unusual consumption

## Benefits

### For Consumers

- **Transparency**: Clear visibility into energy usage
- **Cost Control**: Identify high-consumption appliances
- **Accurate Billing**: No more estimated bills
- **Convenience**: Self-service meter reading
- **Energy Savings**: Behavioral changes from awareness

### For TNB

- **Operational Efficiency**: Reduced manual meter reading
- **Revenue Protection**: Detect tampering and theft
- **Grid Management**: Better load forecasting
- **Outage Response**: Faster detection and restoration
- **Customer Service**: Improved support with data access

### For the City

- **Smart Grid Ready**: Foundation for advanced grid features
- **Demand Management**: Peak load reduction programs
- **Integration**: Connect with other smart city systems
- **Sustainability**: Support energy efficiency goals

## MS ISO 37122:2019 Alignment

This project addresses multiple smart city indicators:

| Theme | Indicator |
|-------|-----------|
| Energy | 7.9 Smart Energy Meter |
| Housing | 12.1 Smart Electric Meter |
