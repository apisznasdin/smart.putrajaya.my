## Overview

The **Smart Pedestrian Crossing** pilot project at **Sekolah Kebangsaan Putrajaya Presint 11(2)** introduces intelligent crossing technology to enhance safety for schoolchildren and pedestrians. Using AI-powered detection and adaptive signal systems, this solution represents the future of road safety in Putrajaya.

## Pilot Location

### SK Putrajaya Presint 11(2)

The pilot site was selected for:

- **High Pedestrian Volume**: Large number of students crossing daily
- **School Zone**: Critical safety requirements
- **Peak Hour Challenges**: Concentrated crossing times
- **Community Impact**: Direct benefit to families
- **Evaluation Potential**: Measurable safety outcomes

## Technology Components

### AI Pedestrian Detection

Advanced computer vision system:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Camera System | High-resolution cameras with AI processing |
| Detection | Real-time pedestrian identification |
| Tracking | Movement prediction and path analysis |
| Counting | Accurate pedestrian volume measurement |
| Special Detection | Children, wheelchair users, elderly |

### Adaptive Signal Control

Intelligent traffic light management:

- **Demand-Based Activation**: Signals respond to pedestrian presence
- **Extended Crossing Time**: Automatic extension for slower pedestrians
- **Vehicle Detection**: Coordinates with approaching traffic
- **Peak Hour Mode**: Optimized timing for school hours
- **Emergency Override**: Priority for emergency vehicles

### Visual Warning Systems

Enhanced visibility features:

| Component | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| LED Ground Lights | Illuminated crossing boundaries |
| Flashing Beacons | High-visibility warning to drivers |
| Digital Signs | Real-time crossing status display |
| Reflective Markings | Enhanced nighttime visibility |

### Audio Alerts

Accessibility-focused audio features:

- Audible crossing signals
- Countdown announcements
- Warning tones for vehicles
- Multi-language support

## Safety Features

### For Pedestrians

- Clear visual indication of safe crossing time
- Extended time for children and elderly
- Warning when signal is about to change
- Protection from turning vehicles

### For Drivers

- Advanced warning of pedestrian presence
- Clear stop signals
- Speed reduction prompts
- Night visibility enhancement

### For Schools

- Synchronized with school schedule
- Peak hour optimization
- Parent notification capability
- Incident monitoring and alerts

## How It Works

### Crossing Sequence

1. **Detection**: AI cameras detect pedestrians approaching
2. **Activation**: System prepares for crossing request
3. **Signal Change**: Traffic signals coordinate stop
4. **Safe Crossing**: Visual and audio confirmation to cross
5. **Monitoring**: Continuous tracking during crossing
6. **Completion**: System confirms all pedestrians crossed
7. **Reset**: Traffic flow resumes safely

### School Hours Operation

During school hours:

- Enhanced sensitivity to children
- Longer crossing times
- More frequent signal cycles
- Increased warning visibility

## Monitoring & Analytics

### Real-Time Dashboard

Control center access to:

- Live camera feeds
- Crossing event logs
- Safety incident alerts
- System health status

### Data Collection

Analytics for continuous improvement:

| Data Type | Use |
|-----------|-----|
| Pedestrian Counts | Volume analysis |
| Crossing Times | Timing optimization |
| Near-Miss Events | Safety assessment |
| Vehicle Compliance | Enforcement support |

## Impact Assessment

### Safety Metrics

Measuring success through:

- Reduction in near-miss incidents
- Improved crossing compliance
- Decreased jaywalking
- Enhanced driver awareness

### Community Feedback

Gathering input from:

- Parents and students
- School administrators
