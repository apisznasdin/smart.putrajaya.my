## Overview

The **Smart Street Light** initiative transforms Putrajaya's street lighting infrastructure into an intelligent, energy-efficient network. By integrating IoT sensors, adaptive controls, and centralized management, this project significantly reduces energy consumption while enhancing public safety and urban aesthetics.

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Pilot with Vectolabs (Urbanlume)

The initial pilot project was implemented in partnership with **Vectolabs**, utilizing their **Urbanlume** smart lighting platform:

- **Technology**: Urbanlume intelligent lighting management system
- **Features**: Remote dimming, scheduling, real-time monitoring
- **Scope**: Selected pilot area to test and validate technology
- **Outcomes**: Proven energy savings and operational efficiency

### Phase 2: Persiaran Perdana Deployment

Following the successful pilot, smart street lights were deployed along **Persiaran Perdana**, Putrajaya's iconic main boulevard:

- **Location**: Persiaran Perdana (main ceremonial boulevard)
- **Coverage**: Full length of the boulevard
- **Visibility**: High-profile showcase of smart city technology
- **Impact**: Enhanced nighttime aesthetics and safety

## Technology Features

### Adaptive Lighting Control

The smart street lights automatically adjust brightness based on:

| Condition | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Pedestrian/Vehicle Detection | Increase brightness in active areas |
| Time of Night | Gradual dimming during low-traffic hours |
| Ambient Light | Compensation for moonlight/weather |
| Special Events | Custom lighting scenes |

### Remote Monitoring & Management

Centralized dashboard provides:

- **Real-Time Status**: Live view of all street light operations
- **Energy Metrics**: Power consumption by zone and time
- **Fault Alerts**: Instant notification of lamp failures
- **Historical Data**: Trends and patterns analysis

### Predictive Maintenance

Smart sensors enable proactive maintenance:

- Lamp life monitoring
- Performance degradation detection
- Automated work order generation
- Spare parts optimization

## Energy Efficiency

### LED Technology

All smart street lights utilize high-efficiency LED technology:

- **Energy Savings**: Up to 60% reduction compared to conventional lights
- **Lifespan**: 50,000+ hours of operation
- **Light Quality**: Better color rendering and uniformity
- **Environmental**: Mercury-free, reduced carbon footprint

### Smart Controls Impact

Additional savings through intelligent controls:

| Feature | Energy Saving |
|---------|---------------|
| Adaptive Dimming | 20-30% additional savings |
| Motion-Based Control | 15-25% in low-traffic areas |
| Scheduling Optimization | 10-15% through precise timing |

## Safety Enhancement

### Improved Visibility

- Consistent illumination levels across all areas
- Reduced dark spots and shadows
- Better facial recognition for security cameras
- Enhanced pedestrian crossing visibility

### Emergency Response

- Priority lighting for emergency routes
- Integration with panic button locations
- Rapid response lighting for incidents
- Coordination with Command Centre

## Future Expansion

### Planned Developments

- Extension to all major roads in Putrajaya
- Integration with smart poles (multi-function)
- 5G small cell hosting capability
- Environmental sensor integration
- EV charging integration at light poles

### Smart Pole Evolution

Future smart poles will incorporate:

- Wi-Fi hotspots
- CCTV cameras
- Environmental sensors
- Public address speakers
- Digital signage
- EV charging points

## Partnership Model

### Technology Partners

- **Vectolabs**: Urbanlume platform provider
- **LED Suppliers**: High-quality luminaire manufacturers
- **System Integrators**: Installation and commissioning

### Operational Benefits

- Reduced maintenance costs
- Lower energy bills
- Extended asset lifespan
- Better service levels
