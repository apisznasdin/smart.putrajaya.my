## Overview

The **Smart Adaptive Traffic Light System** is a landmark infrastructure project that will transform Putrajaya's traffic management. Recently awarded, this initiative will replace **140 traffic light junctions** across the city with state-of-the-art adaptive signal systems powered by artificial intelligence.

## Project Scope

### City-Wide Transformation

| Metric | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Total Junctions | 140 traffic light junctions |
| Coverage | All major roads in Putrajaya |
| Technology | AI-powered adaptive control |
| Integration | Connected to Command Centre |
| Timeline | Phased implementation |

### Objectives

- Reduce traffic congestion by 20-30%
- Decrease average journey times
- Lower vehicle emissions from idling
- Improve emergency response times
- Enhance pedestrian safety

## Technology

### Adaptive Signal Control

Unlike traditional fixed-timing signals, smart adaptive systems:

| Traditional | Smart Adaptive |
|-------------|----------------|
| Fixed timing patterns | Real-time adjustment |
| Time-of-day schedules | Dynamic response to traffic |
| Manual optimization | AI-driven optimization |
| Isolated operation | Network-wide coordination |

### AI & Machine Learning

The system utilizes:

- **Computer Vision**: Vehicle and pedestrian detection
- **Machine Learning**: Pattern recognition and prediction
- **Optimization Algorithms**: Real-time signal timing
- **Neural Networks**: Traffic flow modeling

### Detection Technologies

| Technology | Function |
