## Overview

The **Smart Water Meter** pilot project, implemented in partnership with **Air Selangor**, introduces intelligent water metering technology to selected areas in Putrajaya. This initiative enables real-time water consumption monitoring, leak detection, and improved water resource management.

## Pilot Program

### Objectives

The pilot program aims to:

- Test smart water metering technology in Putrajaya context
- Evaluate consumer acceptance and behavior changes
- Assess infrastructure requirements for full rollout
- Develop operational procedures and support systems
- Measure water conservation impact

### Coverage

The pilot phase covers:
- Selected residential areas
- Government buildings
- Commercial premises (limited)

## Technology Features

### Smart Meter Capabilities

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Real-time Monitoring | Continuous consumption tracking |
| Leak Detection | Automatic alerts for unusual flow |
| Remote Reading | No manual meter reading required |
| Data Analytics | Usage patterns and insights |
| Tamper Alert | Security notifications |

### Consumer Interface

Participants can access their water data through:

- **Mobile App**: Real-time consumption view
- **Web Portal**: Detailed usage analytics
- **SMS Alerts**: Leak and anomaly notifications
- **Bill Preview**: Estimated billing information

## Benefits

### Water Conservation

Smart meters promote conservation through:

- **Awareness**: Real-time visibility drives behavior change
- **Leak Detection**: Early identification reduces waste
- **Usage Insights**: Identify high-consumption activities
- **Benchmarking**: Compare with similar households

### Operational Efficiency

For Air Selangor and city management:

- **Accurate Billing**: Eliminate estimated readings
- **Leak Reduction**: Network-wide loss management
- **Demand Forecasting**: Better resource planning
- **Customer Service**: Data-driven support

### For Residents

- **Cost Savings**: Reduce water bills through conservation
- **Convenience**: No manual meter reading visits
- **Transparency**: Clear understanding of usage
- **Quick Response**: Rapid leak notification

## MS ISO 37122:2019 Alignment

This project addresses smart city indicators:

| Theme | Indicator |
|-------|-----------|
| Water | 22.1 Smart Water Meter |
| Housing | 12.2 Smart Water Meter |

## Implementation Approach

### Phased Rollout

1. **Preparation**: Infrastructure and system setup
2. **Installation**: Smart meter deployment
3. **Onboarding**: Consumer registration and training
4. **Monitoring**: Performance tracking and optimization
5. **Evaluation**: Impact assessment and learning

### Technical Infrastructure

- **Communication**: Cellular/RF network connectivity
- **Data Platform**: Cloud-based meter data management
- **Integration**: Air Selangor billing systems
- **Security**: Encrypted data transmission

## Challenges Addressed

### Non-Revenue Water (NRW)

Smart meters help reduce NRW through:
- Physical loss detection
- Apparent loss identification
- Network monitoring
- Rapid response to leaks

### Consumer Engagement

The project increases engagement through:
- Digital access to consumption data
- Conservation tips and recommendations
- Gamification of water saving
- Community comparisons

## Future Expansion

Based on pilot results, the program may expand to:

- **City-wide Deployment**: All Putrajaya connections
- **Advanced Features**: Predictive analytics, AI-based insights
- **Integration**: Connect with other smart city systems
- **Automation**: Automated leak shutoff capabilities

## Partnership

Air Selangor, the water utility serving Selangor, Kuala Lumpur, and Putrajaya, leads this initiative with support from:

- Perbadanan Putrajaya (coordination)
- Technology partners (smart meter solutions)
- Community representatives (feedback and adoption)
