## Overview

The **Weather Monitoring Stations** network comprises **9 strategically located stations** across Putrajaya, providing hyperlocal weather data in real-time. As part of the Integrated Environment Monitoring System (IEMS), this network supports weather-informed decision making for city operations, public safety, and community activities.

## Network Overview

### 9 Monitoring Stations

Stations are distributed across Putrajaya for comprehensive coverage:

| Coverage Area | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|
| Government Precincts | Official function planning |
| Residential Areas | Community weather service |
| Recreational Zones | Activity planning |
| Low-lying Areas | Flood monitoring |
| Key Infrastructure | Operations support |

### Hyperlocal Advantage

Unlike single-point city weather stations:

- **Localized Data**: Specific readings for each area
- **Microclimate Detection**: Capture local variations
- **Better Accuracy**: Representative of actual conditions
- **Rapid Response**: Detect localized weather events

## Instrumentation

### Multi-Sensor Suite

Each station is equipped with:

| Sensor | Parameter | Unit |
|--------|-----------|------|
| Temperature Sensor | Air Temperature | °C |
| Humidity Sensor | Relative Humidity | % |
| Barometric Sensor | Atmospheric Pressure | hPa |
| Anemometer | Wind Speed | km/h |
| Wind Vane | Wind Direction | Degrees |
| Pyranometer | Solar Radiation | W/m² |
| UV Sensor | UV Index | Index |
| Rain Gauge | Rainfall | mm |

### Rain Bucket System

Precision rainfall measurement:

- **Type**: Tipping bucket rain gauge
- **Resolution**: 0.2mm per tip
- **Accuracy**: High-precision measurement
- **Data**: Accumulated and intensity

## Parameters Monitored

### Temperature & Humidity

| Parameter | Description | Importance |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| Air Temperature | Ambient temperature | Comfort, health |
| Humidity | Moisture in air | Heat index, comfort |
| Heat Index | "Feels like" temperature | Health warnings |
| Dew Point | Condensation temperature | Weather prediction |

### Wind Conditions

| Parameter | Description | Importance |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| Wind Speed | Air movement speed | Outdoor activities |
| Wind Direction | Where wind comes from | Weather patterns |
| Wind Gusts | Peak wind speeds | Safety alerts |

### Rainfall Data

| Metric | Description | Use |
|--------|-------------|-----|
| Current Rainfall | Real-time precipitation | Immediate conditions |
| Hourly Total | Accumulation per hour | Intensity tracking |
| Daily Total | 24-hour accumulation | Flood risk |
| Monthly Total | Long-term accumulation | Water management |

### Additional Parameters

- Solar radiation (UV and visible)
- Atmospheric pressure trends
- Visibility estimates

## Data Integration

### IEMS Platform

All weather data flows into IEMS for:

- Unified environmental dashboard
- Cross-correlation with other data
- Integrated alert system
- Comprehensive analytics

### Public Access

Available at [iems.ppj.gov.my](https://iems.ppj.gov.my/):
