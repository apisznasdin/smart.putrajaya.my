## Overview

The **Integrated Environment Monitoring System (IEMS)** is a comprehensive network of environmental sensors deployed throughout Putrajaya, providing real-time data on air quality, water quality, noise levels, and weather conditions. This system supports environmental management, public health protection, and sustainable urban development.

## Monitoring Parameters

### Air Quality Monitoring

The IEMS continuously tracks multiple air quality parameters:

| Parameter | Description | Health Relevance |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| PM2.5 | Fine particulate matter | Respiratory health |
| PM10 | Coarse particulate matter | Lung function |
| O₃ | Ozone | Respiratory irritation |
| NO₂ | Nitrogen dioxide | Air quality indicator |
| SO₂ | Sulfur dioxide | Industrial pollution |
| CO | Carbon monoxide | Combustion indicator |

**Air Quality Index (AQI)** is calculated and displayed in real-time, providing easy-to-understand health guidance for residents.

### Water Quality Monitoring

Water bodies in Putrajaya are monitored for:

- **pH Level**: Acidity/alkalinity balance
- **Dissolved Oxygen**: Aquatic ecosystem health
- **Turbidity**: Water clarity
- **Temperature**: Thermal conditions
- **Conductivity**: Dissolved solids indicator
- **Ammonia**: Pollution indicator

### Noise Level Monitoring

Ambient noise is tracked across different zones:

- Residential areas
- Commercial districts
- Industrial zones
- Recreational spaces

Noise data helps enforce regulations and plan urban development to minimize noise pollution.

### Weather Monitoring

Comprehensive meteorological data includes:

- Temperature and humidity
- Rainfall and precipitation
- Wind speed and direction
- Atmospheric pressure
- UV index
- Solar radiation

## Sensor Network

### Deployment Strategy
Sensors are strategically placed to ensure comprehensive coverage:

- **Fixed Stations**: Permanent monitoring stations at key locations
- **Mobile Units**: Deployable sensors for targeted assessments
- **Satellite Stations**: Connected to the main network via IoT

### Technology Stack
- High-precision calibrated sensors
- Solar-powered remote stations
- 4G/5G cellular connectivity
- Edge computing capabilities
- Cloud-based data platform

## Public Access Portal

The IEMS data is publicly accessible at [iems.ppj.gov.my](https://iems.ppj.gov.my/):

### Dashboard Features
- **Real-Time Data**: Live readings from all monitoring stations
- **Interactive Maps**: Geographic visualization of environmental conditions
- **Historical Trends**: Time-series analysis and comparisons
- **Alerts**: Notifications when parameters exceed thresholds
- **Downloads**: Data export for research and analysis

### Mobile Accessibility
Citizens can access environmental data on-the-go through:
- Responsive web portal
- Mobile-optimized interface
- Push notifications for alerts

## Applications & Use Cases

### Public Health Protection
